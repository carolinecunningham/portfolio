			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>The MAPC report “Homes for Profit: Speculation and Investment in Greater Boston” mentions that institutional investors are often preferred given that “Cash offers are more appealing to sellers than traditional mortgages”. To understand the potential appeal of these mortgages, I want to uncover to what extent are fully-cash payments made in the Boston market. Specifically, has this trend changed over time (especially since the 2008 recession)?
				</li>
				<li>When on a NYC tour, I remember the guide pointing out that the highly-desirable Park Avenue apartments are often owned by foreign wealth using the apartment as an investment rather than a home. From this experience, I became curious about what regions in Boston are targeted for speculation and, specifically, are high-wealth areas preferred?
				</li>
				<li>The MAPC report finds “flipping to be most common in Greater Boston’s highest value submarket,” which refers to a suburban area outside Boston. Within Boston, I am curious to uncover where flips are most profitable and which communities are most impacted by this trend accordingly. I assume that based on the MAPC finding flips may be most likely in wealthier neighborhoods but this trend may not generalize.
				</li>
				<li>From living in my hometown, I have observed over the years older apartment buildings being fixed up and resold as luxury living apartments. From what I have learned in class, I imagine these properties were flipped and re-sold at higher prices. As such, I am curious to understand what building features (such as when a property was built) affected subsequent price increases?

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				<figcaption>
                To understand the relative prevalence of different buyers on the market, I plotted each type of investor against the total number of properties they owned. Data entries either had single buyer types or multiple; for multiple buyer types, I excluded low-frequency buyers for simplicity of viewing. I also color-coded corporate owners and non-corporate owners given that MAPC excludes GSE / Banks from flipping data and Trusts are individuals. In the graph, we can see that LLCs are the second-highest purchasers of property, just-behind the government-sponsored Freddie Mac / Fannie Mae (GSE), demonstrating the prevalence of institutional corporate investors in the Boston housing market.

				<figcaption>
                    Additionally, I sought to understand market dynamics through plotting the total spending per year in the housing market. We can see the values for the years 2000-2022; generally speaking, during the past few years there appears to be an increase in spending as compared to the 2000s. There is also a noticeable dip in spending during the year 2008, presumably due to the financial crisis. I am curious about if the financial crisis caused the market to favor institutional investors; are investors’ ability to pay in all cash (as mentioned in the MAPC report) increasingly favored post 2008?

				<img src="graphs/A2_Graph2.png" alt="Total Yearly Spending on Residential Sales Compared to All-Cash Payments" style="max-width: 90%;"/>
				<figcaption>
                    Based on my previous question, here I analyze the total yearly spending in the Boston housing market, separating payments made in all-cash (red) from the remaining payments (blue). The amount of money spent in-all cash (found by analyzing transactions where there was not a mortgage) can be considered a close proxy for investor money in the market. We can see that after 2009, the fraction of all-cash money spent is almost equal to money spent with mortgages. This trend’s timing suggests that the prevalence of investors in our market now was aided by the stigma around large mortgages resulting from the 2008 recession.

				<img src="graphs/A2_Graph7.png" alt="Frequency of All-Cash vs Mortgage Transactions in Boston" style="max-width: 90%;"/>
				<figcaption>
                    To further test my earlier conclusions on post-2008 market dynamics, I wanted to see if all-cash payments have become more common or simply have more volume due to being prevalent in expensive transactions. As such, I plotted the number of transactions made in all-cash vs with a mortgage as a function time. We can see that before 2008, mortgages were significantly more common, whereas after 2008 the number of all-cash transactions steadling grew. This trend suggests that the market has shifted to become increasingly favorable to investors, making it harder for people without substantial wealth to find a home in Boston.

				<img src="graphs/A2_Graph3.png" alt="Total Spending 2000-2022 in All-Cash Payments by Boston Zip Code" style="max-width: 90%;"/>
				<figcaption>
                    To answer my second research question, I plotted total spending in all-cash payments (again, as a proxy for investors) across the different Boston zip codes to understand the impact of speculative investment in different regions. I excluded zip codes with 0 or null values for ease of viewing, and for this submission I have zoomed in on the metro Boston region to show full values. The graph shows that the highest amount of all-cash investment is in 02116 (Back Bay), followed second by 02110 (Financial District), suggesting that the wealthiest areas in Boston have been most affected by investor speculation. This finding supports MAPC’s report that the wealthiest Boston sub districts are most affected, driving up prices in already-expensive areas.

				<img src="graphs/A2_Graph4.png" alt="Average Profit by Flip Term across Boston Zip Codes" style="max-width: 90%;"/>
				<figcaption>
					I turned to examining my third research question on how average profit from flipped investments (greater than 0 price difference) varies by residential zip code, separating the data into the flip horizons to better elucidate how spatial patterns may vary with investment type. Color-coding profits with discrete values allow for an easier profit comparison, and I excluded outliers (price differences > ~$40,000,000) for meaningful results. We see that high-income neighborhoods (02116) have profitable short-term flips, but as we increase the flip duration, several other high profit regions appear (02215, 02215, 02109, 02110). That there are multiple zip codes with these higher profits indicate that many communities of Boston are vulnerable to speculation, although more wealthy areas seem more lucrative for quick deals.

				<img src="graphs/A2_Graph10.png" alt="Total Number of Investor-Investor Purchases by Zip Code" style="max-width: 90%;"/>
				<figcaption>
					I then investigated the spatial distribution of investor-investor transactions to further elucidate what neighborhoods may be favored for flipping. For ease of viewing, I filtered out all zip codes with a transaction frequency of less than 3. The graph further proves that most investor-investor transactions occur in the wealthiest neighborhood, as we see that 02116 (Back Bay) has the most occurrences. Interestingly, 02210 (Seaport) has the fewest of the zip codes making the chart, perhaps because of the recent development and commercial focus.

				<img src="graphs/A2_Graph5.png" alt="Average Investment Profit for Multi-Family Residences by Investor Type" style="max-width: 90%;"/>
				<figcaption>
					I then turned to analyzing how much of an average profit investors have made from flipping family residences (strangely, excluding non-flips removed Institutional Investors data from the results). I also filtered out negative profit cases (negative price differences), as these samples did not fit my research goal. The results demonstrate that Large and Medium investors made greater profits than Non-investor or Small investors, and as MAPC defines investor categories by purchase amounts, the data shows that owners with more resources have an advantage when flipping. The large profit margins shown demonstrate that investors are making substantial money through flipping (likely from making building extensions that raise costs); however, for many of these categories there was a small sample size, so further data would be needed to verify the conclusions.

				<img src="graphs/A2_Graph6.png" alt="Average Investment Profit for Apartments and Condos by Investor Type" style="max-width: 90%;"/>
				<figcaption>
					The MAPC report mentions renters as frequently suffering from investors flipping properties, so I applied the same analysis as above but for apartment and condominium properties. Outside the context of residential properties, it seems as though the average profits are more similar between the different investor sizes, although again more data would be helpful to add rigor to this conclusion. Further, we see that there are high profits involved in flipping apartments and condos, signaling that these investments may pose financial barriers for residents.

			<figure>
				<img src="graphs/A2_Graph11.png" alt="Average Price Difference between Transactions as a Function of Lot Size and Year Built" style="max-width: 90%;"/>
				<figcaption>
					Here, I investigated the impact of amenity features, specifically lot size and year built, on the average price difference in flipped transactions. I filtered out nonsensical price increases (e.g. huge price increase due to $1 originally selling price), although some very large price increases remained, so I used a logarithmic scale accordingly. Surprisingly, there is not the trend that flipping (and adding features on) older buildings leads to higher profits, which disagreed with my intuition. I cannot discern a significant relationship between lot size and price increase; the high price differences for lot sizes less than 10,000 appear like noise.

			<figure>
				<img src="graphs/A2_Graph9.png" alt="Flip Percentage Price Change by Housing Amenities for Residences" style="max-width: 90%;"/>
				<figcaption>
					Here, I further investigate how a flipped property’s amenities (total rooms, bathrooms, and bedrooms) aff\ects the percentage price change. For chart modifications, I (1) excluded commercial properties due to their distinct building patterns from residential homes, (2) only considered data for flipped properties, and (3) included a logarithmic scale given the presence of outliers. The graph shows no significant trend between the building features and flipped price percentage change; perhaps other features such as zip code or completed renovations have greater influence.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>In this speculation investigation, I examined market conditions, spatial patterns, flipping profit opportunities, and property features that may lead to greater flipping price mark-ups. I found that in the years after 2008, payments in all-cash became more common by both count and volume of money, suggesting that the financial crisis may have increased the value of a financially-secure institutional investor. Corroborating the MAPC report, I also found that wealthy areas in Boston were most targeted for flipping as well as led to the most profits, demonstrating that the trend of investing in wealthy areas holds true for Boston proper. In my analysis of what types of buildings led to the most profit as well as the greatest differences in price, the most significant conclusions were that the size of the investor seems to correspond to profit opportunities, underscoring that buyers with large financial backings can dominate the market. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In this investigation, I was reminded of the learning from class to pay attention to what data is not being collected, not just what fields are shown. While I was able to access data on buyers and sellers, what was not shown were the residents involved and larger community implications. Given the importance of neighborhoods in forming communities, better understanding the effects of transactions on the people involved is critical for any housing policy discussion.
