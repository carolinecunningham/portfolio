			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>The MAPC report “Homes for Profit: Speculation and Investment in Greater Boston” mentions that institutional investors are often preferred given that “Cash offers are more appealing to sellers than traditional mortgages”. To understand the potential appeal of these mortgages, I want to uncover to what extent are fully-cash payments made in the Boston market. Specifically, has this trend changed over time (especially since the 2008 recession)?
				</li>
				<li>When on a NYC tour, I remember the guide pointing out that the highly-desirable Park Avenue apartments are often owned by foreign wealth using the apartment as an investment rather than a home. From this experience, I became curious about what regions in Boston are targeted for speculation and, specifically, are high-wealth areas preferred?
				</li>
				<li>The MAPC report finds “flipping to be most common in Greater Boston’s highest value submarket,” which refers to a suburban area outside Boston. Within Boston, I am curious to uncover where flips are most profitable and which communities are most impacted by this trend accordingly. I assume that based on the MAPC finding flips may be most likely in wealthier neighborhoods but this trend may not generalize.
				</li>
				<li>From living in my hometown, I have observed over the years older apartment buildings being fixed up and resold as luxury living apartments. From what I have learned in class, I imagine these properties were flipped and re-sold at higher prices. As such, I am curious to understand what building features (such as when a property was built) affected subsequent price increases?

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				<figcaption>
                To understand the relative prevalence of different buyers on the market, I plotted each type of investor against the total number of properties they owned. Data entries either had single buyer types or multiple; for multiple buyer types, I excluded low-frequency buyers for simplicity of viewing. I also color-coded corporate owners and non-corporate owners given that MAPC excludes GSE / Banks from flipping data and Trusts are individuals. In the graph, we can see that LLCs are the second-highest purchasers of property, just-behind the government-sponsored Freddie Mac / Fannie Mae (GSE), demonstrating the prevalence of institutional corporate investors in the Boston housing market.

                    Additionally, I sought to understand market dynamics through plotting the total spending per year in the housing market. We can see the values for the years 2000-2022; generally speaking, during the past few years there appears to be an increase in spending as compared to the 2000s. There is also a noticeable dip in spending during the year 2008, presumably due to the financial crisis. I am curious about if the financial crisis caused the market to favor institutional investors; are investors’ ability to pay in all cash (as mentioned in the MAPC report) increasingly favored post 2008?

				<img src="graphs/A2_Graph2.png" alt="Total Yearly Spending on Residential Sales Compared to All-Cash Payments" />
				<figcaption>
                    Based on my previous question, here I analyze the total yearly spending in the Boston housing market, separating payments made in all-cash (red) from the remaining payments (blue). The amount of money spent in-all cash (found by analyzing transactions where there was not a mortgage) can be considered a close proxy for investor money in the market. We can see that after 2009, the fraction of all-cash money spent is almost equal to money spent with mortgages. This trend’s timing suggests that the prevalence of investors in our market now was aided by the stigma around large mortgages resulting from the 2008 recession.

				<figcaption>
                    To further test my earlier conclusions on post-2008 market dynamics, I wanted to see if all-cash payments have become more common or simply have more volume due to being prevalent in expensive transactions. As such, I plotted the number of transactions made in all-cash vs with a mortgage as a function time. We can see that before 2008, mortgages were significantly more common, whereas after 2008 the number of all-cash transactions steadling grew. This trend suggests that the market has shifted to become increasingly favorable to investors, making it harder for people without substantial wealth to find a home in Boston.

				<img src="graphs/A2_Graph3.png" alt="Total Spending 2000-2022 in All-Cash Payments by Boston Zip Code" />
				<figcaption>
                    To answer my second research question, I plotted total spending in all-cash payments (again, as a proxy for investors) across the different Boston zip codes to understand the impact of speculative investment in different regions. I excluded zip codes with 0 or null values for ease of viewing, and for this submission I have zoomed in on the metro Boston region to show full values. The graph shows that the highest amount of all-cash investment is in 02116 (Back Bay), followed second by 02110 (Financial District), suggesting that the wealthiest areas in Boston have been most affected by investor speculation. This finding supports MAPC’s report that the wealthiest Boston sub districts are most affected, driving up prices in already-expensive areas.
