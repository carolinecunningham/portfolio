			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
			<h3> Question: How have U.S. Demographic Trends with respect to age changed from 1900 to 2000? </h3>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For my first sketch, I wanted to highlight how the number of people varies by age between 1900 vs 2000.
				</li>
				<li>Given the large range in number of people, I used a logarithmic scale. I also chose to combine women and men for simplicity.
				</li>
				<li>In the sketch, while the overall trend is visible, the granularity of differences between individual data points is hard to perceive. Additionally, the dot representation for data values meant compromising on accuracy, as it was harder to note small value differences.   
				</li>
				<li>Accordingly, for my next sketch I would like to explore a better way of small trends in data being visible.				</li>
			</ul>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For my second sketch, I was inspired online to use a stacked bar chart to highlight granular differences with greater ease. 
				</li>
				<li>By placing bars on top of each other, combined with the symmetry of the graph, I hoped that smaller trends would be easier to perceive.
				</li>
				<li>Additionally, I chose to aggregate age by decade for ease of comparison.  
				</li>
				<li> In the resulting sketch, I find it easier to see overall trends; however, we have lost some nuance by aggregating age and gender. </li>
				<li> For my next sketch, I hoped to explore the same dataset question but for men versus women.</li>
			</ul>

				<figcaption>
                 Number of People by Age Group and Gender, 1900 vs 2000.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this sketch, I have de-aggregated the data by gender to highlight any gender-specific trends.				</li>
				<li>To represent all variables, I created a “quad chart” with Male vs Female on the horizontal axis and Year on the vertical axis. I then plotted the age group versus the number of people on the x and y axes respectively.				</li>
				<li>From this sketch, while I am able to perceive each of the values,  the sheer amount of data almost makes this chart look misleading, like I should be searching for some broader overall pattern as opposed to population trends broken down by gender.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
		My strongest sketch is Sketch 2 due to the ease of comparison provided by the stacked
		bar chart. While Sketch 1 shows the similar information, the dot data value notation makes individual differences harder to perceive; additionally, the format of the y-axis “inverts” expectations for trend lines. Sketch 3 is also harder to perceive, but for a different reason: the large amount of data / information makes synthesizing an overall trend more challenging for the viewer. In the next phase, I hope to create a visual with the crispness of Sketch 2 but with more data points / information included like in Sketch 3.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				For my visualization, I wanted to highlight how demographic trends by age may have changed between 1900 to 2000. My graph demonstrates that older age groups have a greater proportional age increase as compared to any other age cohort.

				My first major design decision was to plot percentage increases from 1900 to 2000 as opposed to actual values for both years. I calculated the percentage increase using the standard percentage increase formula. This choice came with the tradeoff that trends within the same year are lost to the reader; however, I would maintain from this decision my graph answers my main question more clearly. My second design decision was to display the values for both men and women and keep all data to 1 graph and axis. While having multiple bar charts sharing an axis would perhaps allow for greater in-depth comparisons, I again prioritized simplicity so that someone on their first read can ascertain the main message. Additionally, I learned from a friend that it is best to display percentage increases as bar charts to clue the reader that you are plotting an increase, which resonated with material we’ve learned in this class about perception.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
		From phase 1, I learned that multiple charts / axes can be overwhelming to the reader. Looking at my Sketch 3; the overall “oval-ish” shape is more clear than any meaningful trends within the data! As such, I decided to transform the data to clarify my message. I also liked how in my Sketch 2 having bar charts allowed for easier value comparisons, further motivating the decision towards bar charts in the final product.

		<h3>Collaboration</h3>

		<p>
			For this assignment, I received help from a friend outside this class on transforming the data values in Excel to plot the percentage differences. She also told me that people have an easier time understanding a data increase in the form of a bar chart.
