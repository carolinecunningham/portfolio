    <h2>Proposition: Across the globe, average temperatures have increased over the past two decades, serving as a warning signal for climate health.

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Data Section: My first decision was to hand-pick what two years of data to contrast to emphasize rising global temperatures. To maximize the contrast effect, I looked for a year that has a positive, linear relationship with 2022 data to highlight a temperature increase. Selecting a particular year of data because it fits the point you want to make is deceptive in nature, and I hoped that choosing the most recent year (2022) as the dependent variable would make my choice of independent variable less questionable. Deception Score: -1.5
				</li>
				<li>Outlier Exclusion: My second decision was to exclude 2 countries from the dataset for the sole reason that their data was anti-pattern. Given the large number of countries, I do feel like this omission is easy to miss for a viewer, but it would make me vulnerable to anyone asking for follow-up information or my raw data. Deception Score: -2
				</li>
				<li>Trend Line: To further emphasize my point that global trends are increasing, along with the individual data points I displayed a linear regression trend line. Adding this trend line gives mathematical credibility to my assertion and guides the viewer’s eye towards seeing the data points as fitting a positive, linear model. I also include the formula below for further emphasis but omit the weak R^2 of 0.39. Deception Score: -0.5.
				</li>
				<li>Color: My final design decision was to put the data points in red as a visual signal of warming temperatures. Inspired by last week’s visualization from the reading group, I hoped the bold color would make the message of the visualization more memorable and persuasive. Deception Score: -0.5. 
				</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="graphs/A4_Con_Visualization.png" alt="" style="max-width: 90%;"/>
				<figcaption>
          Percent Change in Temperature from 1990 to 2022 (with Respect to Baseline Climatology) has Stayed Cnstant in the Majority of Countries, IMF
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Percent Transformation: Since the goal of this assignment is to be persuasive at all costs, I chose to transform the data by calculating percentage change from 1990 to 2022. As compared to the direct difference in average temperatures, percentage change has significantly more values taken on by the data, which allowed me to imply that smaller percentage changes are insignificant. Deception Score: -1
				</li>
				<li>Map: For this visualization, I chose to display the data for each country on a global map, allowing viewers insight into where data was from. Additionally, since most countries had small percent changes in temperature, the map adds visual credibility to my stance that temperature remained similar in the majority of locations. Deception Score: +0.5.
				</li>
				<li>Colors: I used a color where a “neutral” / gray shade represents a small, positive percentage change. As we tend to associate neutral with 0, this coloring is deceptive through supporting the argument while not quite matching up with the data. I also chose blue as positive and red as negative, inverting associations, to decrease the emphasis on any rising global temperatures. Deception Score: -1.5
				</li>
				<li> Color Scale: For the color scheme, I also showed a continuous color scale as opposed to discrete steps to further add ambiguity to the values of the percent differences. Depending on the viewer, this could backfire, as a savvy viewer could correctly interpret that neutral colors are “unclear” as a negative towards the designer. Deception Score: -1.5
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		
		I felt very uncomfortable completing this assignment; even though my goal was to be as persuasive as possible, it felt very wrong to me to utilize deceptive techniques. From this assignment, I learned how external conditions can affect pressures on data visualization designers and how those pressures may advertently or inadvertently shape outcomes. In the real world, people tasked with the goal of proving something at all costs may desperately resort to deceptive techniques, as the thoughts going through our minds shape how we view the world. Many of my techniques lied on the more deceptive side, which feels ethically wrong to me.

		I now define “ethical analysis and visualization” as showcasing the data in a manner to allow the viewer to form their own conclusions as opposed trying to force a perception onto them. For better or for worse, I am now much more skeptical of people who create visualizations of data that advance their own agenda; I believe that audits by external organizations are a check that should be utilized. I also do not believe in bounds between “acceptable” persuasive choices versus “misleading ones” unless said persuasive choices have been made to better express the data (e.g. apply a data transformation that makes information easier to digest) as opposed to advancing a predefined outcome. There is a difference between highlighting data that supports your cause versus making the data support your cause.
